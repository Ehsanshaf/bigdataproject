#### Project Description
The project which the repository is about is a competition posted on Kaggle.com. The kick off of the project was in May, 2017 and the time given is 3 months, meaning the deadline is the end of July, 2017.

#### Predictive Analytics

R-code can be finded in the belonging folder of this repository. These scipts also include some explanations about our approach and used commands. 

* [Markovchain](https://github.com/vhwr/bigdataproject/tree/master/01_Markovchain) 
* [Apriori](https://github.com/vhwr/bigdataproject/tree/master/02_Apriori) 
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/vhwr/bigdataproject/tree/master/03_XGBoost) 
* [RNN]() 

#### Data Analysis
The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. Moreover, the week and hour of day the order was placed are also provided, and a relative measure of time between orders.
